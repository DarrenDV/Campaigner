# Campaigner

## About

Campaigner is a tool for visualizing your tabletop RPG campaigns, a story telling tool.
A DM can create spaces (levels, rooms, dungeons, etc) to build visual environments for their story. 
These spaces can be brought to live with decorations and pawns (actors). 
When having built a space, the DM can host the space online and invite their players to view their created world. 
The DM can then control aspects of the world such as locations of objects, hidden objects, etc to immersive-ly tell their story. 
Players will be limited to the amount of interactivity they have, but GAMEâ€™s ultimate goal is to replace currently used tools such as roll20.
